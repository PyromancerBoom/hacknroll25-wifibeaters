The sunlight streamed through the window, casting golden hues across the room. Laughter bubbled up as Emily read the letter aloud, her voice brimming with excitement. The words on the page held promises of adventure, of friendships yet to be made, and dreams that suddenly felt within reach. The faint scent of blooming roses wafted in through the open door, adding to the sense that everything in the world was exactly as it should be.

The rain tapped steadily against the glass, a somber rhythm that mirrored the ache in his chest. James held the photograph tightly, his fingers trembling. He traced the edges of the frame, his eyes lingering on the faces that once brought him so much joy. Now, they were only memories, shadows of a time he could never reclaim. A heavy sigh escaped his lips as he slumped back into the chair, the weight of loss pressing down on him like a storm.

The air in the room felt charged, as though the very atmosphere had absorbed her rage and was ready to erupt.
