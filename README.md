# TunedIN - HacknRoll 25 Project by WifiBeaters (Atharva, Priyansh, Jason)

Welcome to **TunedIN**, a HacknRoll 25 project that leverages the power of machine learning to deliver awesome background music.

• Built an AI-powered background music generator based on peer-reviewed research that assigns emotionally suitable music to text PDFs using ML-based mood detection.
• Overcame rate limits, frontend glitches, and precision-complexity trade-offs to deliver a functional and engaging prototype.
• Developed semi-supervised learning for song categorization and deployed a working frontend/backend solution.
• Skills: Next.js, Python, FastAPI, ML (in python), Render, Vercel

## Overview
**TunedIN** is designed to:
- Receive users' text in the form of PDF files
- Analyze the text to find matching moods in songs
- Return a list of background music which matches the current segment of text

This project was developed during HacknRoll 25 as a quick prototype to explore innovative solutions for the issue of boring reading sessions, difficulties in finding suitable music for content creation, and for general-purpose entertainment-based reading. Partially inspired by this research which sttaes that entertaining music affects our cognitive function while reading: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1140959/full?utm_source=perplexity
